        Yes, that's correct! Battery swapping is a technology that allows users of electric vehicles to quickly and easily exchange depleted batteries for fully charged ones at specialized stations. This can eliminate the need for long charging times, as swapping a battery can take just a few minutes. Additionally, swapped batteries can be charged and ready for the next user, reducing the need for a large number of individual batteries and potentially reducing their overall cost and size.
